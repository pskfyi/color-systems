# 4-Color Systems

A 4-color system is the smallest sensible color system. It supports 6 pairs and 4 trios. Including prismatic and colorless, this gives a 4-color system an impressive 16 [color identities](./../color-identities.md) - twice as many as the 3-color system, marking the largest percentage increase between any two systems. If these combinations are permissible, the 4-color system punches far above its weight.

It also features relatively flexible tranche sizes, making it manageable to add proportional numbers of dualcolor and tricolor entities.

In this system, the 6 color pairs are special. They represent 3 dualities of 2 pairs each, which can be used to express yin/yang, hot/cold, and similar conceptual mirror pairs. This has an elegant 2s-within-2s fractal pattern - the 4 colors can be viewed as a duality of 2 colors each.

Unfortunately, trios in most 4-color systems occupy an inappropriate place, acting more as not-colors. (ex. in a Red/Green/Blue/White system, the trio Red/White/Blue is essentially "not-Green".)

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche           | Size |
| :---------------- | ---: |
| Monocolor         |    4 |
| Dualcolor         |   18 |
| Tricolor          |   16 |
| Dual-and-Tricolor |   52 |
