# 3-Color Systems

A 3-color system is the smallest sensible color system. It supports 3 pairs and 1 trio. Including colorless and the trio, the system supports a meager 8 [color identities](./../color-identities.md). The system is exceptionally extensible, though, due to its tiny tranche size.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche           | Size |
| :---------------- | ---: |
| Monocolor         |    3 |
| Dualcolor         |    9 |
| Tricolor          |    4 |
| Dual-and-Tricolor |   13 |
