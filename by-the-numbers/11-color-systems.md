# 11-Color Systems

A 11-color system is perhaps the absolute least exciting. Its 55 pairs are barely manageable. Including prismatic and colorless, and excluding trios, this gives a 11-color system 68 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Like the 10-Color system, this system's dualcolor tranche is clunky and pushing its limits.

Because the system has a prime number of colors, it is not divisible into any beautiful sub-pattern.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche   | Size |
| :-------- | ---: |
| Monocolor |   11 |
| Dualcolor |  165 |
