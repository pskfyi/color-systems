# 5-Color Systems

A 5-color system is a strong system that you generally should not use. If you do, your game will be considered by many to be a knockoff of Magic the Gathering.

It supports 10 pairs and 10 trios, the only system to afford such symmetry. Including prismatic and colorless, this gives a 5-color system 27 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Aside from the dual-and-tricolor tranche, it features relatively flexible tranche sizes. Sadly trios aren't very appropriate in the system, diminishing the utility of these flexible tranches.

Color pairs shine in this system because they occupy a minority of the color space for the first time, lending them expressive power. Trios are still clumsy though, occupying a majority of the color space. This can be mitigated with judicious use of colorless cards.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche           | Size |
| :---------------- | ---: |
| Monocolor         |    5 |
| Dualcolor         |   30 |
| Tricolor          |   40 |
| Dual-and-Tricolor |  130 |
