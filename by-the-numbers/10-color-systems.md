# 10-Color Systems

A 10-color system is one of the least exciting. Its 45 pairs are pushing feasibility and its 120 trios surpass it. Including prismatic and colorless, and excluding trios, this gives a 10-color system 57 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Its dualcolor tranche is very unwieldy and pushing plausibility.

Pairs are all the system has going for itself. Quintets are infeasible, and trios are inelegant in a system not divisible by 3.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche   | Size |
| :-------- | ---: |
| Monocolor |   10 |
| Dualcolor |  135 |
