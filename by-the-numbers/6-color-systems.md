# 6-Color Systems

A 6-color system is an elegant and expressive system that you should strive for. It supports 15 pairs and 20 trios, making it the smallest system to support more trios than pairs. Including prismatic and colorless, this gives a 6-color system a whopping 43 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Its dual-and-tricolor tranche pushes the limits of feasibility, but its other tranches are far more manageable

This system is unique because of its divisibility combined with minimal size. It is the smallest system whose colors are a multiple of two primes: 2 and 3. From this property it divvies its pairs into 5 trialities and its trios into 10 dualities. This makes a 6-color system perfect for triadic themes like high/middle/low or fast/slow/stop, alongside being home to a family of unique, rich dualities like simple/complex or material/immaterial. The 6-color system is primed for systemic designers.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche           | Size |
| :---------------- | ---: |
| Monocolor         |    6 |
| Dualcolor         |   45 |
| Tricolor          |   80 |
| Dual-and-Tricolor |  260 |
