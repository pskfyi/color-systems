# 12-Color Systems

A 12-color system is the last exciting system. Its 66 pairs are at the limits of manageability. Including prismatic and colorless, and excluding trios, this gives a 11-color system 80 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Like the 10-Color system, this system's dualcolor tranche is clunky and pushing its limits.

Unlike the 8-to-11-color systems, the 12 color system has a beautiful symmetry just like the 6-color system, but additionally can support a subset of both trios and quartets,

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche   | Size |
| :-------- | ---: |
| Monocolor |   12 |
| Dualcolor |  198 |
