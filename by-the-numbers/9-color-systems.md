# 9-Color Systems

A 9-color system is clumsy but generally preferable to the 8-color system. It supports 36 pairs and 84 trios. Like the 8-color system, it can't adequately support all of its trios, but it is highly amenable to including a subset of them. Including prismatic and colorless, and excluding trios, this gives a 9-color system 47 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Its dualcolor tranche is unwieldy but not implausible.

Pairs are a strong aspect of the system, but focus shifts to the trios which can be added in thematic trialities.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche   | Size |
| :-------- | ---: |
| Monocolor |    9 |
| Dualcolor |  108 |
