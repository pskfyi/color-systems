# 7-Color Systems

A 7-color system is a tight, intricate system which is the last to adequately support color trios for all possible three-color sets. It supports 21 pairs and 35 trios. Including prismatic and colorless, this gives a 7-color system a mighty 65 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md).

Its dual-and-tricolor tranche is the upper bound of feasibility. A total set of entities restricted to a single one of these tranches would be a beautiful, maximalist game that favors multicolor expressiveness over the inter-pair or inter-trio relationships that the 6-color system provides.

This is the first system in which trios represent a minority of the color space, making them mechanically closer to pairs. This frees the trios from having to represent anything beyond their constituent colors. If you want a system that maximizes the possibility space of multicolor, this is the one for you.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche           | Size |
| :---------------- | ---: |
| Monocolor         |    7 |
| Dualcolor         |   63 |
| Tricolor          |  140 |
| Dual-and-Tricolor |  455 |
