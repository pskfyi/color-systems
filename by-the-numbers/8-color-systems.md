# 8-Color Systems

An 8-color system is awkward and not recommended. It supports 28 pairs and 56 trios, but is the smallest system to not adequately support trios. It is recommended that they be excluded, and the math here will do just that. Including prismatic and colorless, and excluding trios, this gives a 8-color system 38 possible [color identities](./../color-identities.md), fewer than the 7-color system.

Its dualcolor tranche is manageable but beginning to become unwieldy.

Pairs are the lifeblood of the system. It may be desirable to break them into 7 dualities-within-dualities or quadralities. The system is also the first, and one of very few, to be amenable to quartets, albeit not an exhaustive collection of them.

## Tranches

Entities can be added to the game in batches of the following sizes. Refer to [tranches.md](./../tranches.md) for more detailed information on the contents of each tranche.

| Tranche   | Size |
| :-------- | ---: |
| Monocolor |    8 |
| Dualcolor |   84 |
