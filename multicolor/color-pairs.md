# Color Pairs

Color pairs are the most accessible and easily designed form of multicolor. It is easy to envision what a crossover of two things might be, and it is an enjoyable design activity to the point of being addicting. The danger with color pairs is the danger of biting off more than you can chew.

## Appropriateness

Color pairs are appropriate in any color system with at least 3 colors, no matter how big or small. As long as you respect the maxim that [monocolor matters most](../design-principles.md#monocolor-matters-most), you can't dilute your system with color pairs.

In a 3-color system, say Red/Green/Blue, pairs are still interesting propositions even though a pair such as Red/Green is as much a representation of "not Blue" as it it a representation of Red and Green together. Contrast that with a 5-color system like Magic's, where a quartet of 4 colors Red/Blue/Green/Black only really represents "not White" rather than saying much about the constituent colors. With the pairs, you can add as many as you'd like and it only makes the system richer, as long as you add a proportional number of monocolor entities to compensate.

In a 4-color system, pairs have a special place, forming a complement with another pair with which they express a duality.

## Primacy vs Coequality

Consider a pair Red/Green. One way to design with this pair is to treat Green/Red as a separate pair, and to make the first color the "primary" color. Maybe a forest fire is Green/Red, while a flaming arrow is Red/Green.

Another way to design these pairs, and the more common way, is to treat Green/Red and Red/Green an interchangeable, making the colors "coequal." Maybe a forest fire and a flaming arrow are both Red and Green and that's all that needs to matter.

A system with primacy in its color pairs has twice as many color pairs available as a system that treats colors within a pair as coequal.

## Numbers

The number of available pairs scales with the number of colors in the system. Google "X choose 2" where X is the number of colors in your system to see how many pairs it supports. Multiply the number by 2 if you want to see how many pairs you'd get if you want to leverage the concept of [primacy](#primacy-vs-coequality) explained above.

| Colors | Pairs |
| :----: | :---: |
|   2    |   1   |
|   3    |   3   |
|   4    |   6   |
|   5    |  10   |
|   6    |  15   |
|   7    |  21   |
|   8    |  28   |
|   9    |  36   |
|   10   |  45   |
|   11   |  55   |
|   12   |  66   |

## Color Wheels

If you use a [color wheel](../color-wheels.md), pairs naturally arise from adjacent colors on the wheel. In the design of Magic the Gathering these are called "allied pairs", where other pairs are called "enemy pairs". You can also see a color wheel in the design of Hearthstone, which arranges its 10 classes such that each class only pairs with two others, forming a circle of class pairs.
