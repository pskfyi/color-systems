# Color Trios

Color trios are challenging to design, but in most circumstances they are the only other plausible color combination to design for. It's just too hard to figure out what a Red/Pink/White/Purple entity could be, and signing up for designing entities for all the other color combinations is just too prohibitive.

## Appropriateness

The appropriateness of color trios varies significantly with the number of colors in a system.

In a 4-color system, trios are inappropriate because they are more about the color they exclude than the ones they include. 5-color systems have the same issue, but less so.

In a 6-color system, trios cover exactly half of the color space and form a duality with a complementary color trio. These are where trios shine best, because they are simultaneously about their constituents, their exclusions, and a particular duality they comprise. Similar phenomena emerge in any system with a number of colors that's divisible by 3.

Only in a system with 7 or more colors do trios represent a minority of the color space, making them more and more about their constituents than their exclusions.

A 9-color system is a unique sweet spot, where trios for trialities with each other, creating a fractal system of threes-within-threes.

## Coequality

Trios are not amenable to [primacy](./color-pairs.md#primacy-vs-coequality) in most circumstances, because each trio has 6 permutations. It's unmanageable. The default strategy for handling pairs is via [coequality](./color-pairs.md#primacy-vs-coequality).

## Numbers

The number of available trios scales with the number of colors in the system. Google "X choose 3" where X is the number of colors in your system to see how many trios it supports.

| Colors | Trios |
| :----: | :---: |
|   3    |   1   |
|   4    |   4   |
|   5    |  10   |
|   6    |  20   |
|   7    |  35   |
|   8    |  56   |
|   9    |  84   |
|   10   |  120  |
|   11   |  165  |
|   12   |  220  |

## Color Wheels

If you use a [color wheel](../color-wheels.md), trios naturally arise from adjacent colors on the wheel. In the design of Magic the Gathering these are called "shards", where other trios are called "wedges".
