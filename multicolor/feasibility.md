# Multicolor - Feasibility

The feasibility of color pairs within your system is dependent on several factors.

If you are content with not representing every combination equally, there is little danger in allowing pairs regardless of the number of colors your system includes. But if you insist on treating each pair equally, then you must understand the combinatorics of pairs within your system. In a 5-color system, there are 10 viable pairs, but in a 12-color system there are 66 pairs. If you intend to add colors to your system over time, or to leave the door open for that possibility, take care to establish your policies about color pars

If you have a color wheel or some other way to group your colors, you may choose to only represent particular color pairs. In Hearthstone there are Warrior/Paladin cards, but no Warrior/Mage cards.
