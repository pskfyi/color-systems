# Multicolor - Combination and Synthesis

In a color system, the concept of multicolor arises in two distinct ways.

## Combinatorial Multicolor

This arises when a multicolor entity includes themes from each of its constituent colors. Sand is Yellow and water is Blue, so a beach is Yellow/Blue via combination. Similarly a hurricane is a combination of Water and Air.

These multicolor entities do not expand the design space of their constituent colors. They represent something about how those colors interplay, but do not open new possibilities for monocolor entities.

These only work when both colors are available. A mage who only casts Air spells but cannot cast Water spells should not be able to conjure a hurricane.

## Synthetic Multicolor

This arises when a multicolor entity includes novel themes which are not directly associated with its constituent colors. Perfect examples are when Fire and Water make steam, or associating America with Red/White/Blue.

These multicolor entities expand the design space of their constituent colors. They represent shared dimensions of both colors which can be elaborated upon in monocolor entities.

These work even when some colors are unavailable. If lightning is a synthesis of Air and Fire in your world, then either a Fire mage or an Air mage should be able to cast it. They don't have to be an Air & Fire mage.
