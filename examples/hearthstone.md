# Color System Example - Hearthstone

Hearthstone is a card game that started with a 9-color system supporting colorless entities. It expanded to become a 10-color system.

The system is focused on colorless entities over colored entities, and has only included multicolor entities twice in its history. This leaves Hearthstone with a very flexible tranche structure, making it easy to expand. A mini-expansion for Hearthstone is capable of including as few as 10 cards. The game is also capable of adding the remaining two WoW classes with minimal disruption.

## Themes

Hearthstone calls its colors "classes", and models them after character classes from World of Warcraft.

Dualcolor cards are "dual-class" cards, and tricolor are "tri-class" cards. Tricolor cards were only offered in one set during the 9-color era,

## Era 1: 9-Color

The 9-color era had simple 9-card monocolor tranches and single-card colorless tranches. The set 'Mean Streets of Gadgetzan' included 3x special 3-card, tricolor tranches.

## Era 2: 10-Color

The 10-color era has simple 10-card monocolor tranches and single-card colorless tranches. The set 'Scholomance Academy' included 4x special 10-card, dualcolor tranches.
