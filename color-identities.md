# Color Identities

Borrowed from Magic the Gathering design, this term refers to which colors an entity possesses. For example an RGB color system supports seven standard color identities:

- monocolor: R, G, and B

- dualcolor: RG, RB, and GB

- tricolor: RGB

## Primacy

If a system's multicolor supports [primacy](./multicolor/color-pairs.md#primacy-vs-coequality), this impacts color identities. Given capital letters expressing primacy and lowercase letters expressing secondary status, an RGB system with primacy would support XXX identities:

- monocolor: R, G, and B

- dualcolor: Rg, Rb, Gr, Gb, Br, and Bg

- tricolor: Rgb, Grb, and Brg

## Colorless

[Colorless](./colorless.md) is a possible color identity. Not all systems support colorless. Colorless is like a color, but it cannot be combined with other colors.

## Prismatic

"Prismatic" is a name for an all-color identity. Prismatic entities are entities that belong to all colors in the system.

Not all systems can conceptually distinguish between prismatic and colorless.
