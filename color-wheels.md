# Color Wheels

A color wheel is a representation of colors as being adjacent to one another. Color wheels establish relationships between colors via geometric representations.

## Arrangement

A wheel is helpful in any situation where the colors need to be displayed alongside one another, for example in a menu. Choices could be arranged alphabetically, which would change from language to language, or they might be arranged in some thematic order, and that order would represent a color wheel.

## Ramifications

When defining a color wheel, consider what you intend for it to convey. Is it merely an ordering of the colors? Or are the pairs of adjacent colors thematically notable? What about "primary" vs "secondary" colors? Are there "complementary colors" across the wheel? For example Magic's 5-color system constructs a wheel where colors don't have opposites so it is incapable of expressing complementary colors, so instead it characterizes adjacent colors as "allies" and non-adjacent colors as "enemies".

If you intend for your color system to be open to adding additional colors in the future, consider what impact that will have on your color wheel. For example, because only a wheel with an even number of colors contains "complementary" relationships, you have to add colors two-at-a-time if you want to preserve existing complementary relationships and those colors have to be a complementary pair themselves.
