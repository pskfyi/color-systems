# Colorless

Most color systems support colorless entities in one manner or another. In many systems, the majority of entities are colorless, and colored entities spice things up. Hearthstone is such a system.

Colorless can be modeled as a special color in the system which is not allowed to be a part of multicolor entities. In systems with colorless but no multicolor, colorless is essentially another color.

Theming of colorless can vary wildly. In some systems, colorless is the default state of all entities, making it a mish-mash or dumping ground category. This goes hand-in-hand with making colors more exclusive about what they choose to include. (Hearthstone follows this model.) Other systems model colorless with its own thematic space, treating it like a special color.
